# CourseManager

This project was part of practice in Santander's bootcamp promoted by Digital Inovation One.

## Development server

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 11.2.8.

Go to 'assets > server' folder and run `npm start` to put on backend server.

Run `npm start` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
